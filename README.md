This repository contains the ontology developed as part of my honors project, “[An ontology for the south african protection of personal information act]”. 

The ontology provides a proof of concept semantic representation of a knowledge base for the regulations in the Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 (POPIA) and how it affects the various role players. 

The POPIA is closely aligned with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the POPIA ontology is inspired by similar ontologies developed for the GDPR.

For detailed insights and methodologies related to this project, please refer to the associated research paper:
